## Introduction

ðŸŒ³ `xleaf` is a python package for running leaf and canopy simulation models using PROSAIL. It provides python bindings to the PROSPECT-D & 4SAIL [Fortran code](http://teledetection.ipgp.jussieu.fr/prosail/).

ðŸŒ¿ It includes sensible defaults that make it easy to get up and running quickly, and clear code documentation in the form of docstrings and type hints.

ðŸ“š All credit for the fundamental modeling code and for the underlying science belongs to the original researchers. Please see their most recent research:

## Usage

```python
import xleaf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# run with off-the-shelf defaults
leaf = xleaf.simulate_leaf()

# or specify detailed parameters
canopy = xleaf.simulate_canopy(
    chl = 40, # ug/cm2
    car = 8, # ug/cm2
    antho = 0.5, # ug/cm2
    ewt = 0.01, # cm
    lma = 0.009, # g/cm2
    N = 1.5, # unitless
    lai = 3.0, # m2/m2
    lidf = 30, # degrees
    soil_dryness = 0.75, # %
    solar_zenith = 35, # degrees
    solar_azimuth = 120, # degrees
    view_zenith = 0, # degrees
    view_azimuth = 60, # degrees
    hot_spot = 0.01, # unitless
)

# and plot them together
plt.plot(xleaf.parameters.wavelengths, leaf, label='leaf')
plt.plot(xleaf.parameters.wavelengths, canopy, label='canopy')
plt.legend()
```

The definition and expected range of values for each parameter is described in the `xleaf` docstrings.

## Install

```
pip install xleaf
```

This may require a FORTRAN compiler. So on ubuntu you could run `sudo apt install gcc` and on macos you'd run `brew install gcc`.
